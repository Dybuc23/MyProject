### Railway

Bring your code, we'll handle the rest. Made for any language, for projects big and small. [Railway](https://railway.app/)
is the cloud that takes the complexity out of shipping software.

Create a new empty project in Railway and start by creating a PostgreSQL database. Once you have that created you can create
a new project from GitHub. You can use the following environment variables based on the database you just created.

```properties
spring_profiles_active=prod
MYSQL_DB_HOST=containers-us-west-32.railway.app
MYSQL_DB_PORT=5742
MYSQL_DB_NAME=railway
MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD=CjnY5wQzOOxMvmHxAcgX
MYSQL_DB_USERNAME=root
